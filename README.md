# Hey! So, you're viewing my profile...
## Lets just get straight to it shall we?

Well, I'm working on some new tweaks with ajaidan0 and I've got a react native client for pognet in the works.

### ðŸŒ± Ok, what are you learning?
Aren't we all still learning? Anyways, I'm learning react native and still learning Objective-C as I continue making tweaks.
